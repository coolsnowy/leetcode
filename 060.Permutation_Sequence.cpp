/**
 * The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

    By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
    We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):

    "123"
    "132"
    "213"
    "231"
    "312"
    "321"
    Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

    Note: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.

    /*
     * I'm sure somewhere can be simplified so it'd be nice if anyone can let me know. The pattern was that:

        say n = 4, you have {1, 2, 3, 4}
        If you were to list out all the permutations you have
        1 + (permutations of 2, 3, 4)
        2 + (permutations of 1, 3, 4)
        3 + (permutations of 1, 2, 4)
        4 + (permutations of 1, 2, 3)

        We know how to calculate the number of permutations of n numbers... n!
        So each of those with permutations of 3 numbers means there are 6 possible permutations.
        Meaning there would be a total of 24 permutations in this particular one.
        So if you were to look for the (k = 14) 14th permutation, it would be in the
        3 + (permutations of 1, 2, 4) subset.

        To programmatically get that, you take k = 13 (subtract 1 because of things always starting at 0)
        and divide that by the 6 we got from the factorial, which would give you the index of the number you want.
        In the array {1, 2, 3, 4}, k/(n-1)! = 13/(4-1)! = 13/3! = 13/6 = 2. The array {1, 2, 3, 4} has a value of 3 at index 2.
        So the first number is a 3.

        Then the problem repeats with less numbers.
        The permutations of {1, 2, 4} would be:
        1 + (permutations of 2, 4)
        2 + (permutations of 1, 4)
        4 + (permutations of 1, 2)

        But our k is no longer the 14th, because in the previous step, we've already eliminated the 12 4-number permutations starting with 1 and 2.
        So you subtract 12 from k.. which gives you 1. Programmatically that would be...
        k = k - (index from previous) * (n-1)! = k - 2*(n-1)! = 13 - 2*(3)! = 1

        In this second step, permutations of 2 numbers has only 2 possibilities,
        meaning each of the three permutations listed above a has two possibilities, giving a total of 6.
        We're looking for the first one, so that would be in the 1 + (permutations of 2, 4) subset.

        Meaning: index to get number from is k / (n - 2)! = 1 / (4-2)! = 1 / 2! = 0.. from {1, 2, 4}, index 0 is 1

        so the numbers we have so far is 3, 1... and then repeating without explanations.
        {2, 4}
        k = k - (index from pervious) * (n-2)! = k - 0 * (n - 2)! = 1 - 0 = 1;
        third number's index = k / (n - 3)! = 1 / (4-3)! = 1/ 1! = 1... from {2, 4}, index 1 has 4
        Third number is 4
        {2}
        k = k - (index from pervious) * (n - 3)! = k - 1 * (4 - 3)! = 1 - 1 = 0;
        third number's index = k / (n - 4)! = 0 / (4-4)! = 0/ 1 = 0... from {2}, index 0 has 2
        Fourth number is 2
        Giving us 3142. If you manually list out the permutations using DFS method, it would be 3142. Done!
        It really was all about pattern finding.
